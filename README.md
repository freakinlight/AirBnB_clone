# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Description
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project is the first step in building a comprehensive web application that replicates the functionalities of AirBnB. The initial phase involves creating a command-line interface (CLI) to manage the application's objects. This CLI allows users to create, read, update, and delete various objects such as Users, States, Cities, and Places.

The project aims to provide a solid foundation in object-oriented programming (OOP) with Python, covering key concepts like serialization/deserialization, file storage, and unit testing.
